Functions in C language - POP  
-----------------------------------
What is function ?
	-> function is named program which is used to perform specific task.
    -> for example in C language, we use 'printf' function to display message on screen. 
                                         'scanf' function is used to take input from user using keyboard.

    -> We should use one function to perform only one task.
        eg: printf function only prints some message on screen
	
	-> we can call function (run function) as many times as we need. 
	
	-> each function has name and at least one line of code in it however we can add any line of coding in function 
	-> function can also have inputs known as parameters or arguments it is optional, function process input and may optionally return at most one output. 

Why we need function ? 
    -> To avoid repeated code { DRY - do not repeat yourself } and make code more readable, we need to use function 
    -> Like when we use variables to use a values as many time as we need, we use functions to use some code as many times as we need

type of function 
-----------------------------------
built in function / library function
	-> Functions which are ailable in C language is called built in function or library function such as printf, scanf, etc 

user defined function ( UDF )
	-> Functions created by us ( developer ) as per requirement is called user defined function.


how to create function { syntax }
-----------------------------------
      
	return_type function_name (datatype variable-name, [datatype variable-name....]) {

        // function - body - code 

	}
	
	function_name(parameters); 

	example 
	void printstar(int height) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= height; i++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
	}
	
how to call function / run function?
	syntax
		function-name() 
example 
void main() {

	int h = 20;
	printstar(h); // calling function printstar to print 20 astrik on new line 
	printstar(12); // calling function printstar to print 12 astrik on new line 

}

return type 
    void -> dont return any value 
    int -> return int type value
    float -> return float type value
    char -> return char type value
    bool -> return boolean type value -> true / false
